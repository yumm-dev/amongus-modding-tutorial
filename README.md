# How to Install/Update Among Us Mods
## Making a Modded Instance (Preparation) | Skip if you're updating
1. Go to your Steam Library. Right click Among Us on the left side, and navigate to Manage → Browse local files.

2. Go up one folder, where you can see all of your games in their folders. Select Among Us, and duplicate it (Copy + Paste in the same area). Rename the new folder to whatever you'd like, so long as you can remember it.

3. Return to your Steam Library. Press the `+ Add a Game` button in the bottom left, then press `Add a Non-Steam Game...`

4. Select `Browse...` and navigate to the modded folder you made in Step 2. Open said folder, and select Among Us.exe (or just Among Us if you can't see file extensions). After 'opening' it, it should be auto-selected in the Steam "Add a Game" menu. You may now press `Add Selected Programs`.

5. You should now have a second Among Us in your library. You'll know if it's the one you added because the logo and background in it are bland. You may customize this to your liking using images and opening its Properties menu to change the name and icon. I recommend using [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/) for this. Now, see below.
## [Town Of Us: Mira](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira/releases/latest)
1. Open the link above and download the proper ZIP file (indicated by the names of each) If you are updating to a new version, download the DLL files.

2. Navigate to the downloaded file(s). This is usually in Downloads on your PC.
3. Click the ZIP file, right click it, and select Extract Here / Extract All. If you downloaded the DLL files and are updating your modded game, go to the Submerged section and see Step 2 onwards, replacing every mention of Submerged.dll with the DLL files you have.
4. Open the folder. (You may need to open the sub-folder if it's a repeat of the name.) Select all of the contents and copy (or cut) them. Paste them into the folder you made in the previous section.

## [Submerged](https://github.com/SubmergedAmongUs/Submerged/releases/latest)
1. Open the proper link above and download the DLL file.

    ![Visual of Step 1.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96a71475-72d6-4407-b2b4-fa2fd722a519)

2. Select the Submerged.dll file you downloaded and copy/cut it. Find your modded folder.
3. Once opened, navigate to BepInEx → Plugins. Paste the DLL file into the folder. If it requests for permission to replace a file, agree to it.

    You are finished installing your Among Us Mods. See below for launching your game.
## Launching your Modded Among Us Instance
Select the modded Among Us duplicate you made in Section 1 and press the Play Button. If you did everything right, it should take a couple minutes (depends on the speed of your computer) before it launches for the first time. If you see the following menu (or something similar), you did everything right and can play modded Among Us without issues.

(Note: After launching modded AU successfully for the first time, subsequent launches will be much faster. This is normal, because the first launch is setting up all of the mods for the first time, so it preps everything.)

## Extra: Downgrading Your Among Us Version
In the case that Among Us has updated, 9 times out of 10, the mods will not work with the new version out of the box. If an update to the mod for fixing this issue is not yet released, and you have not already made your Among Us instance, you will have to downgrade your Among Us version before you can get the mods to work.
1. Navigate to your Steam Library. Right click on Among Us (or press the gear icon on its library page), and press Properties.

2. In the Properties menu, press Betas on the sidebar, then select the Beta Participation dropdown menu and select `public-previous`. Once that finishes downgrading, follow the guide as normal.
