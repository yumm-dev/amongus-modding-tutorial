# How to Install Among Us Mods
## Making a Modded Instance (Preparation)
1. Go to your Steam Library. Right click Among Us on the left side, and navigate to Manage → Browse local files.

2. Go up one folder, where you can see all of your games in their folders. Select Among Us, and duplicate it (Copy + Paste in the same area). Rename the new folder to whatever you'd like, so long as you can remember it.

3. Return to your Steam Library. Press the `+ Add a Game` button in the bottom left, then press `Add a Non-Steam Game...`

4. Select `Browse...` and navigate to the modded folder you made in Step 2. Open said folder, and select Among Us.exe (or just Among Us if you can't see file extensions). After 'opening' it, it should be auto-selected in the Steam "Add a Game" menu. You may now press `Add Selected Programs`.

5. You should now have a second Among Us in your library. You'll know if it's the one you added because the logo and background in it are bland. You may customize this to your liking using images and opening its Properties menu to change the name and icon. I recommend using SteamGridDB for this. Now, see below.
## [Town Of Us R](https://github.com/eDonnes124/Town-Of-Us-R/releases/latest), [The Other Roles](https://github.com/TheOtherRolesAU/TheOtherRoles/releases/latest) or [Stellar Roles](https://github.com/Mr-Fluuff/StellarRolesAU/releases/latest)
1. Open the proper link above and download the .zip file. (In this image's case, it's ToU.v5.1.1.zip. Do not download the source code.)

    ![Visual instructions for Step 1.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56fbca46-6804-4f67-92ce-f9f8281a32aa)

2. Navigate to the downloaded file. This is usually in Downloads.
3. Click the file, right click it, and select Extract Here. (If you're on Windows 11, you may have a button that does the same thing. Use that.)
4. Open the folder. (You may need to open the sub-folder if it's a repeat of the name.) Select all of the contents and copy (or cut) them. Paste them into the folder you made in the previous section.

    See below.
## [Submerged](https://github.com/SubmergedAmongUs/Submerged/releases/latest)
1. Open the proper link above and download the .dll file.

2. Find your modded folder. Once opened, navigate to BepInEx → Plugins. If Submerged.dll is already inside that folder, then you are already done and may delete the file you downloaded. Otherwise, proceed to step 3.
3. Select the Submerged.dll file you downloaded and copy/cut it. Then, navigate back to your modded folder and into BepInEx/Plugins, pasting it into the folder.

    ![End result of Step 3.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f0cb752-32e2-4ba8-9518-4518f8072ffc)

    You are finished installing your Among Us Mods. See below for launching your game.
## Launching your Modded Among Us Instance
Select the modded Among Us duplicate you made in Section 1 and press the Play Button. If you did everything right, it should take a couple minutes (depends on the speed of your computer) before it launches for the first time. If you see the following menu (or something similar), you did everything right and can play modded Among Us without issues.

(Note: After launching modded AU successfully for the first time, subsequent launches will be much faster. This is normal, because the first launch is setting up all of the mods for the first time, so it preps everything.)
